# Contributing to Awesome Data & AI Stack

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this curated list! This document provides guidelines for adding new repositories and maintaining the quality of the collection.

## Submission Guidelines

### What We're Looking For

- **Active repositories**: Must be actively maintained with recent commits
- **Production-ready tools**: Tools used in real-world enterprise environments
- **Quality over quantity**: We prioritize well-documented, stable projects
- **Unique value**: Avoid duplicates; ensure your suggestion adds distinct value

### What We Don't Accept

- Personal projects without significant community adoption
- Abandoned repositories (no activity in 6+ months)
- Duplicate entries of existing tools
- Tools without proper documentation
- Academic-only projects without practical application

## How to Contribute

### 1. Format Requirements

Each entry must follow this exact format:
```
- [repository-name](https://github.com/user/repo) - Brief description explaining what the tool does and its main benefit
```

### 2. Description Guidelines

- **Concise**: 1-2 lines maximum
- **Informative**: Clearly explain what the tool does
- **Professional tone**: Enterprise-focused language
- **No marketing fluff**: Stick to factual descriptions
- **Highlight unique features**: What makes this tool different?

### 3. Categorization

Choose the most appropriate category:

- **AI Agents & Frameworks**: For agent-related tools (use subcategories)
- **Data Engineering & Analytics**: For data pipeline, ETL, and analytics tools
- **ML & Data Science**: For machine learning, model training, and data science workflows
- **DevTools & Infrastructure**: For development tools and infrastructure
- **Web & Apps**: For web applications and frontend tools
- **Learning & Reference**: For educational content and documentation
- **OCR & Document Processing**: For document parsing and OCR tools
- **Content & Productivity**: For content creation and productivity tools
- **Avatar, Video & Image AI**: For media generation and processing

If you're unsure about categorization, suggest a new category in your PR.

### 4. Quality Checks

Before submitting, verify:
- [ ] Repository is actively maintained (commits within last 6 months)
- [ ] Has proper README documentation
- [ ] Stars count > 50 (exceptions for very new, high-quality tools)
- [ ] Link works correctly
- [ ] Not already listed in the collection
- [ ] Follows the exact format requirements

## Submission Process

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Create a branch** for your contribution
3. **Add your entry** in the appropriate category, maintaining alphabetical order
4. **Update the Table of Contents** if adding a new category
5. **Submit a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title: "Add [tool-name] to [category]"
   - Description explaining why this tool belongs in the list
   - Confirmation that you've checked the quality requirements

### PR Description Template

```

**Why this tool belongs in the list**:

All submissions are reviewed for:
